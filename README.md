*A collection of structural dynamics tools in MATLAB â€” from Jeffcott rotors to AI-enhanced vibration monitoring.*

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and simulation tools developed for analyzing structural dynamics problems in aerospace and mechanical systems. The codebase includes classical methods like modal analysis and Jeffcott rotor modeling, as well as modern approaches using machine learning for anomaly detection.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Jeffcott rotor simulation (orbit plots, critical speed analysis)
- Campbell diagram generation
- Modal analysis and frequency response tools
- MATLAB-based autoencoder for vibration anomaly detection
- Signal processing and visualization for structural vibration

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Deep Learning Toolbox (for ML scripts)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (recommended)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo and run any of the scripts directly in MATLAB:
```matlab
run('jeffcott_rotor_analysis.m')
